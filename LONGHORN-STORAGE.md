### üìå Structured Plan for Dynamic Pod Deployment with Optional Longhorn Storage :

üéØ Objective

* Deploy pods dynamically in Kubernetes using YAMLs.
* Optionally attach a Persistent Volume (PV) using Longhorn when required.
* Ensure that if storage is not needed, the pod runs without a volume.
* Ensure that if storage is needed, a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is created and mounted.

#### üîπ Workflow :

1Ô∏è‚É£ Receive Deployment Request

A request is sent to deploy a pod.
The request includes or excludes a "use_storage" flag.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check if Storage is Required

If no storage is required, deploy the pod without a volume.
If storage is required, proceed to the next step.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New PVC (If Storage is Required)

A new PVC is created for the pod.
The PVC uses Longhorn storage with ReadWriteOnce (RWO) mode.
Each pod gets a unique PVC, meaning pods cannot share storage (for now).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Pod

If no storage is required, deploy the basic pod YAML.
If storage is required, deploy the pod with the newly created PVC mounted.

### Manifest :

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-app-pvc
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce  # Only one pod can mount this volume
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi  # Request 5GB of storage
  storageClassName: longhorn  # Ensure this matches your Longhorn StorageClass
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: debian
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/data"
          name: my-app-volume
  volumes:
    - name: my-app-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-app-pvc

```

### Postgresql with PVC :

```
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: postsql
  namespace: dbaas-test
spec:
  instances: 1
  storage:
    size: 2Gi
    storageClass: longhorn

```
