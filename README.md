### Abstract  

This project delivers an integrated cluster management system for the College of Computing, enhancing user engagement and experience in the SIMLAB cluster. Built on Kubernetes, it enables seamless deployment of distributed systems, machine learning, big data, and batch workloads. The system embraces Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate infrastructure provisioning and meet diverse user needs.  

---

### Technical Requirements  

The system must fulfill the following requirements:  

#### 1.1 User Access Management  
Managing access for multiple users across various departments is crucial to ensure security and efficiency.  

#### 1.2 Computing Resource Allocation  
As the SIMLAB cluster includes CPU and GPU nodes, the system must dynamically allocate resources based on task requirements without user intervention. Testing will be conducted in a controlled environment before deployment.  

#### 1.3 User-Friendly Experience  
The system will support users with varying levels of expertise:  

- **Expert Users**: Direct CLI interaction for job creation.  
- **Intermediate Users**: Web interface with pre-configured environments.  
- **Beginner Users**: Assisted workflow for running code and datasets effortlessly.  

#### 1.4 Automation & Process Optimization  
To bridge knowledge gaps, the system integrates automated workflows via IaC, simplifying deployment and execution while improving user experience.

-## Implementation Plan for Secure Cloud Management  

### High-Level Overview  

This section outlines the key steps to build a secure and efficient cloud management platform with **Keycloak** for authentication and **Kubernetes** for orchestration. The focus is on **security, access control, and seamless integration** with OpenStack.  

---

### 1. Secure User Authentication & Authorization with Keycloak  

- **Authentication**: Implement **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** with **Keycloak** to enforce **secure user authentication**. Keycloak acts as the **identity provider (IdP)**, centralizing user access control.  
- **Authorization**: Define **role-based access control (RBAC)** policies to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., admin, developer, viewer).  
- **Integration with Kubernetes**: Use **Keycloak tokens** for authentication within **Kubernetes clusters**, ensuring only authorized users can interact with cluster resources.  

---

### 2. Web UI Framework  

- Build a **ReactJS**-based web interface for interacting with OpenStack resources.  
- Ensure **secure session management** and **token-based authentication** using **OIDC**.  

---

### 3. Integration with OpenStack API  

- Utilize OpenStack's **RESTful APIs** to manage cloud resources (compute, networking, storage).  
- Implement **secure API communication** using **JWT tokens** and **OAuth2.0** to authenticate API requests.  

---

### 4. Secure Storage Management  

- Ensure **resource provisioning and lifecycle management** is **isolated** per user or project.  
- **Encrypt sensitive state files** and **store them securely** to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Implement **role-based storage access** for data isolation.  

---

### 5. Concurrency & State Management  

- Implement **fine-grained locking** to handle concurrent access to resources.  
- Maintain **separate, securely stored state files** per user to prevent conflicts and unauthorized modifications.  

---

### 6. Asynchronous Operations  

- Offload **resource-intensive tasks** to background jobs.  
- Use **message queues** and **event-driven workflows** to prevent UI blocking.  
- Provide **real-time progress updates** via WebSockets.  

---

### 7. Logging, Monitoring & Security Auditing  

- Implement **detailed logging** to track user actions and API interactions.  
- Use **Keycloak audit logs** for **security monitoring**.  
- Enable **Kubernetes RBAC auditing** to detect unauthorized API requests.  
- Integrate **SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)** tools for real-time threat detection.  

---

### 8. Testing & User Training  

- Conduct **penetration testing** to identify security vulnerabilities.  
- Implement **role-based testing** to ensure **secure multi-user access**.  
- Provide **user training & documentation** on best security practices.  

---

By integrating **Keycloak for authentication**, **RBAC for authorization**, and **secure API & storage management**, this solution ensures a **robust, secure, and scalable cloud management system**.
